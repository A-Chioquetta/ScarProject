# ScarProject

Simulations of quantum many-body systems focusing on the PXP model, Rydberg chains, Schrieffer-Wolff (SW) corrections, and constrained subspace analysis.
This project includes dynamics, entanglement entropy calculations, overlap with eigenstates, and studies of projected and non-projected perturbations.

## 🚀 How to Run

Run from the project root:

```bash
python run/run_pxp.py
python run/run_pxp_perturbation.py
python run/run_pxp_sw.py
python run/run_rydberg.py
python run/run_entropy.py
python run/run_overlap_plot.py
```

> ✅ **IMPORTANT:** Always run from the project root `ScarProject/`.  
> ✔️ If using VS Code, it works perfectly with the PLAY button if you have `.vscode/settings.json` configured or the magic line `sys.path.append()` at the top of the scripts.
